Key Findings

Daily activity
A significant number of days are classified as sedentary, although moderate and active levels combined exceed sedentary time.

Activity intensity
Most of the movement corresponds to light activity, with limited time spent in intense physical activity.

Temporal patterns
Users show structured activity patterns during weekdays and more flexible behavior on weekends.

Activity and sleep
No strong correlation was found between daily steps and sleep duration, suggesting that sleep behavior depends on multiple factors.

Business Insights

The results suggest opportunities to:

personalize notifications based on activity level

adapt reminders according to the day of the week

promote sustainable habits rather than high-performance goals

integrate activity and sleep monitoring into a holistic wellness approach
